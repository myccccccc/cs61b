All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: we can use helper function like wrapIndex to make our code concise

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I think the way I deal with the Index is pretty efficient

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: None

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: Code resue is very efficient

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Nothing

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: addFirt and addLast is pretty the same, so I can use code reuse
